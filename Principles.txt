SRP - Single Responsibility principle

     - Cohesion is degree to which the various parts of software component are related
          -> Higher cohesion helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle

     - Coupling is defined as the level of inter dependency between various software components
          -> Loose Coupling helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
     - Every software should have only one reason to change

OCP - Open closed principle

     - Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension

     Often requires decoupling so it automatically follows the SRP

LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle

     Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affection the correctness of the program

ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

     - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use 

     Identify by fat interfaces

     Identify by interfaces with low cohesion example scan, fax are complete different things

     Identify by blank implementations of interface

DIP - Dependency inversion principle

     - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

     - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

     We can get instance of lower level module using Factory Class | Dependency Injection (Pass class instance into constructor)

     Dependency injection solves as well tight coupling
     
     Example: 
          Class is depend on -> Class 2 
          Goal is to inverse dependency:
               We change to Class is depend on -> Interface <- Class2 is depend on Interface
